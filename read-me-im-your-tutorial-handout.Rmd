## Overview
For your modelling tutorial, you will be using a globally parameterised steady-state soil C model to make predictions about soil carbon dynamics in an agricultural setting. The scenario you will be modelling is based on barley production at Bush Estate farm, near Penicuik. You will use the model to set up a number of different management scenarios, and to make predictions about what effect these management practices would have on soil carbon stocks for the land in question.

## How does the model work?
The model is a simplified, three-pool soil carbon model. These three pools are differentiated primarily by different decay rates (i.e. rates at which soil carbon is lost, via microbial mineralisation, to the atmosphere as CO~2~). These pools are:

1. The active pool, which varies the most year on year, and has the highest rates of inputs and decay. It is fed by organic C inputs and by the slow and passive pools.

2. The slow pool, which varies less than the active pool and has lower decay rates. It is fed by the active pool and by organic C inputs.

3. The passive pool, which has the slowest rates of input and decay. It is fed by the active and slow pools only---it does not receive any direct organic C inputs.

The model simulates the flow of organic carbon into, out of and between these pools. The result can be used to estimate the net removal or addition of CO~2~ to or from the atmosphere. Environmental parameters for the model include monthly temperature, monthly precipitation, monthly potential evapotranspiration and soil sand fraction. Management related parameters include C inputs from crops, lignin and N content of organic matter, tillage practices and manure inputs. All of these things affect how quickly the pools gain and lose carbon, and how carbon flows between them.

Full details of the model implementation can be found in Chapter 5 of [this document](https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/vol4.html). It's somewhat heavy going, but it will answer any and all questions you may have about the intricacies of the model.

## How is this scenario set up?
This scenario has been set up for barley production on Bush Estate farm (SRUC's campus farm near Penicuik, south of Edinburgh) for the years 1980 to 2070. Since the model relies greatly on climate parameters, I have used a mixture of historical data (up to 2019) and climate predictions (2020--2070) to set up this implementation of the model. Future climate is uncertain, so from 2019 onwards, you will see the model run multiple (*n* = 100) scenarios which capture this uncertainty. We could easily run more scenarios, but 100 makes for a good balance between insight and computational demand.

Climate prediction data are sourced from the UKCP and can be found [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/ukcp/download-data).

In this implementation, the model utilises three main data files. These are found in the **model-data** folder and are as follows:

1. Crop data (default file = **bush-estate-barley-crop-data-1980-2070.csv**). This file tells the model what crop is being grown, how much yield it produces, and what management practices are used. This file can be opened, viewed and edited easily using MS Excel or any other spreadsheet program.

2. Manure data (default file = **bush-estate-manure-application-1980-2070.csv**). This file tells the model what manure is used, and how much (if any) is applied. This file can also be opened, viewed and edited easily.

3. Climate data (default file = **bush-estate-1980-2070-climvars-100-samples.rds**). This file tells the model what the climate is like over the duration of the model run (precipitation, temperature and so on). It is saved in a .rds format (R's native file format) as it is quite large and complex. You aren't intended to open, view or modify this file for this tutorial!

To create new model scenarios, you will manually modify the first two files. For details on how to do this, refer to the **Model Scenarios --- Your Tasks** section, below.

## Getting started
This tutorial will involve using R and RStudio. For those of you who are less than confident in this environment, fear not---it is entirely possible to complete the tutorial, and its learning objectives, to a high standard **without** doing any coding whatsoever. For those R enthusiasts amongst you, you will have all of the code with which this model was built and executed, and you play with it as much as you like.

Regardless of where you are on the R enthusiasm scale, you need to make sure of the following before you start:

1. You have R version 3.6.2 or higher installed on your computer. You can check the version of R you are running by typing `R.version.string` into the console, and R will return the version for you. If you are not running v3.6.2 (or you don't have R installed at all), [this page](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html) provides install links for Windows and MacOS.

2. You have RStudio version 1.2.5033 or higher installed on your computer. You can check this by opening RStudio and going to 'About RStudio' on the top menu (the exact location varies depending on Mac/Windows layouts). If you don't have this version installed, you can find the install link for Mac and Windows [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

3. You have the `tidyverse` and `shiny` packages installed and up to date. This is crucial---the model won't run without this step! This simplest way to check this is to type `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "shiny"))` into the console and hit return. If you don't have them installed, this will install them; if you do, it'll update them as necessary.

> Note: I realise it's annoying to go through these steps before starting. It's good practice to update your R/RStudio versions regularly---it saves annoying errors and time wasted trying to figure out why. If you really want to skip the first two steps, you can, but if anything goes wrong when running the model, please come back to this stage and update everything as a first port of call. The last step (installing your packages) is not optional, and all you will see is an error message if you skip this one.

## Using the model
For instructions on using the model, you should refer to the screen recording also included in your download folder, where a walkthrough demonstration of opening and usign the the model is provided. As a quick reminder, here are the steps you need to go through to run the Shiny app version of the model:

1. Open RStudio.

2. In the top right-hand corner of RStudio, click the dropdown arrow next to where it says **Project: None** (note, if you already have an RStudio Project open, it'll say the name of that project instead of **Project: None**. Close it now if this is the case. If you don't know what an RStudio Project is, don't worry about it!).

3. Click **Open Project** and navigate to the folder where you've saved and extracted the tutorial download. Double click on the **.RProj** file to open it (it'll be the only one in the folder that's not greyed out).

4. Click to the files tab in your bottom right-hand window, and click on the file entitled **app.R**.

5. When **app.R** opens in your main window, look for the green *Play* button on the top right of that window, with **Run App** written next to it. Click that button and the model UI will launch.

6. You are now ready to set up and run model scenarios using the data input tools provided. Refer to the screen recording for a full walkthrough of this process.

## Model Scenarios --- Your Tasks
Once you have familiarised yourself with using the model, try modifying the model to analyse the following scenarios:

1. Open the default manure input data (**model-data/bush-estate-manure-application-1980-2070.csv**). Use it as a basis to create a manure input .csv file where, from 2020 until 2070, the manure N inputs (column `man_nrate`) are 50 kg N ha^-1^ year^-1^, and the manure type (column `man_type`) is "Beef cattle". Save it in the **model-data** folder with a new name, and use this as the manure input file for your modified scenario. Compare it to the baseline scenario (manure N inputs = 0 kg N ha^-1^ year^-1^). What difference does it make?

2. Create some more versions of this manure input file with different N rates and different manure types. Use the model parameter file **parameter-data/manure-coefficients.csv** to see what other types of manure the model will recognise. What difference do they make? Which manure is the most effective for soil carbon sequestration?

3. Try creating a scenario where the crop residues are left on the field, rather than being removed. Open the default crop data input file **model-data/bush-estate-barley-crop-data-1980-2070.csv** and modify the `frac_remove` column so that from 2020 onwards, `frac_remove` (short for fraction of crop residues removed) is equal to zero. Save it in **model-data** under a new name, and use it to run the modified scenario in your model. Does it make much difference to the soil carbon stocks?

4. Model a switch to reduced or zero tillage from 2020 onwards. You should have noticed the tillage column in the default crop data input (**model-data/bush-estate-barley-crop-data-1980-2070.csv**). Other tillage types recognised by the model are `reduced` and `zero`.

5. The model also recognises different crops. Open the file **parameter-data/crop-N-and-lignin-fractions.csv** to see which it recognises. What if Bush Estate rotated barley with alfalfa every four years from now until 2070? Try modelling it---you can assume a yield of 15 tonnes ha^-1^ year^-1^ and a `frac_remove` of 0.7.

6. *"You're the soil scientists.... You figure it out!"* By now you should have a pretty good idea of what the model can do. Use what you've learned to try and figure out an optimal scenario for C sequestration on Bush Estate's barley enterprise. Be reasonable and realistic! The model is only as good as its inputs, and it won't keep you right if you tell it you're putting 2000 tonnes ha^-1^ of manure nitrogen on your land. If you need a good source for realistic farm data and practices, the SAC Farm Management Handbook can be read online [here](https://www.fas.scot/publication/farm-management-handbook-2019-20/).

7. How can you best present the results of what you've done? The model gives you some default output data and plots, but also the option to export your raw data. Open this up in a spreadsheet program and play with some visualisations.

## Your lab report
Your lab report should include the following:

1. A summary of the model scenarios you ran (1--6 in the above section **Model Scenarios --- Your Tasks**) including input data values used, and model outputs. The latter can include numeric outputs, app-generated plots (you can screengrab these from the app), and plots you've made yourself using data exported from the model.

2. A detailed description of your 'optimal' scenario (number 6 in the above section). What final system did you define? How did you arrive at this system? What is your view, as a soil scientist, of what the model is telling you? Does it seem realistic?

3. An answer to the following question: *How could this implementation of this model be validated against real-world data*? Use what you know about model validation (think last week's slides) and soil science to answer this question. Be as specific as you like, but try to keep in mind realistic constraints (e.g. on data collection, laboratory analysis, and so on).

For your information, the marking process for your lab report will use the following structure:

> Intro/Aims/Discussion: X/10  
> Core scenarios: X/50  
> Optimal scenario: X/15  
> Discussion of validation: X/10  
> Presentation: X/15  

## Some pointers

You'll notice that redefining your data inputs gives you the option to change crop and manure types. Ideally, I'd like you all to look at the model's code and figure out what it's doing when you tell it what crop or manure type is being used --- but I understand that you're under time pressure, and also that this stuff is not easy. So, to help you out, here's a quick crib-notes section to let you know what's possible.

Adding the following crops will work just fine (careful with spelling):

```{r crop-types, echo=F, message=F}
read_csv("parameter-data/above-ground-residue-coefficients.csv")$Crop
```

You'll notice that some are specific and some are general --- if you can find the right crop, specific is better, but the general entries give you some more flexibility. Note that "nos" in this context stands for "not otherwise specified".

For manures, the following options are already parameterised in the model:

```{r man-types, echo=F, message=F}
read_csv("parameter-data/manure-coefficients.csv")$Livestock_type
```

If you really want to get clever, you can modify or add to this data. It's saved in the `parameter-data` folder. Anything you add, the model will be able to recognise --- though you may have to reload the app.

## For the ambitious
Some (optional) tasks to tax the skills of any R/modelling geeks out there:

1. The baseline crop data (**model-data/bush-estate-barley-crop-data-1980-2070.csv**) is created using the R script **barley-yield-simulation.R**. It has been done using a very simple method. Can you improve it?

2. The system climate data used by the model is saved as **model-data/bush-estate-1980-2070-climvars-100-samples.rds**. Though modifying it isn't necessary for this tutorial, open it up in R and see how it looks. How about trying a basic sensitivity test of the model's reliance on climate by raising and lowering the monthly average temperature by 1^o^C?

## That's all folks
I hope this makes for an interesting session. Feel free to play with the model as much as you like, and experiment with its capabilities. You are the guinea pigs for this session, since no-one else has gone before. I'd very much like to hear what you think of it --- so any feedback, questions, comments or queries, please don't hesitate to drop me an email.
